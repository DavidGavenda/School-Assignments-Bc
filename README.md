## OOP - Object oriented programming 
Brief course outline: 
This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of the object-oriented paradigm with the use of Java language. It begins with core principles such as coupling and cohesion, object creation, and usage of static methods, followed by an overview of Java basics. The course proceeds with class creation, encapsulation, and associations between classes, along with an exploration of packages and interfaces. Topics like nested types, programming against interfaces, and event handling are also covered. Further, the course delves into advanced topics such as inheritance, abstract classes, exceptions, and generic types. The course concludes with a study of collections and algorithms, enum types, input/output streams, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

## PROG1 - Programming 1 
Brief course outline: 

This course provides an introduction to the Python language and the creation of algorithms. It starts with basic algorithmic constructs and working with numbers, followed by the exploration of nested loops and functions. Students will learn about variables and the concept of call by value and reference. The course also covers composite data types, with an emphasis on strings, searching and sorting techniques, and recursion. The use of file handling in Python and working with a graphical user interface is also introduced, rounding off a comprehensive overview of the Python language and multiparadigm programming.

## PROG2 - Programming 2

It begins with the foundational concepts of algorithmization, followed by an overview of C's syntactic elements, flow control, functions, and subroutines. The course proceeds with a study of variables, data types, operators, expressions, and basic I/O operations. The students will explore logical expressions, conditions, branching, and loops. They will then learn about the file system and standard C libraries. Memory organization and the pointer data type are also covered, as well as complex data types and structures. One-dimensional and multidimensional arrays are studied, along with characters and strings, and dynamic memory management.

## PT - Programming techniques
